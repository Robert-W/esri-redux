* Snapshot testing can be very useful if used correctly, but sometimesits pretty tough to do
when you are including 3rd party libraries via generic 'import' statements. Unless addressed
properly, Jest will try to path them explicitly and it will be zero fun setting them up after
you've written a bunch of code. Here we run a test on a higher level component that has hard
esri dependencies.
